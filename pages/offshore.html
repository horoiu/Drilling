				<h1>How we drill offshore ?</h1>
				<p>Well, we have a lot of options to drill offshore, some are cheap and some are expensive. It all depends on water depth. The more deeper the water is, the more expensive will be the costs.</p>
				<p>All pesonnel is accomodated onbord in private rooms or in shared room, for 2/4 persons. Usually they will stay onboard based on afixed schedule: 2 weeks ON and 2 weeks OFF. Or 4 weeks, or even 5 weeks, all depending on the drilling company.</p>

				<p>Since there will be 2 shifts onboard all the time, the working hours are 12 ON and 12 OFF, 7/7 days, with no hollidays...</p>
				<p>Normally, the crew will get onboard by choppers on a crew change day, or by PSV's (Platform Supply Vessels) which are special boats, but only in extreme cases.</p>
				<p>Onboard we have everithing we need: from entertainment room, to a gym, or cinema. You can find also a pool-table, if you are lucky.</p>
				<p>Best thing, in my oppinion, is the restaurant, or galley, as we call it. Since the cooks are cooking for more than 100 persons 3 times per day, the food is awesome and really tastes great.</p>
				<p>So, to drill offshore we can use:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Jack-Up Rigs;</li>
					<li>Semi-Submersible Rigs;</li>
					<li>Drill-Ships.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>What is a Jack-Up rig ?</h1>
				<p>Also known as Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODU) or Self Elevating Drilling Units (SEDU), these rigs can drill in a water depth ranging from 10 meters to approx. 120 meters.</p>
				<img class="push-right" id="offshore3" title="Click to enlarge picture !!!" src="http://ctsi.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/maersk-intrepid.png" onclick="big3()" onmouseout="small3()";/>
				<p>As the name of Self Elevating says, these rigs can elevate themselfs, as they have legs. 3 or 4 of them, depending on design, which are operated from Controll Room by Barge Captain/Engineer. The legs are protruding the hull and and will be pushed deep in the sea bottom. This way the rig can elevate above the sea level in order to avoid the waves hitting the hull.</p>

					<h1>And what about Semi-Submersibles ?</h1>
					<img class="push-right" id="offshore4" title="Click to enlarge picture !!!" src="http://worldmaritimenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Singapore-Sembcorps-Jurong-Shipyard-Wins-USD-568-Million-Contract.jpg" onclick="big4()" onmouseout="small4()";/>
					<p>Well, they are huge floating units, fitted with some big submersible water tanks which are filled with water in order to lower the Center of Gravity of the unit to gain more stability while it floats. She will slightly move up and down with the waves while she will meintain its fixed GPS position using its own anchors, or, by a more advanced technology: trusters & proppelers wich are beeing controled by a Dynamic Positioning system.</p>
					<p>These units can drill in maximum water depth of approx. 3.000 m.</p>
				</div>	
				<h1>So a Drill-Ship is a ship ?</h1>
				<img class="push-right" id="offshore5" title="Click to enlarge picture !!!" src="http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Pacific-Khamsin-664x358.jpg" onclick="big5()" onmouseout="small5()";/>
				<p>Exactly. They are ships designed to drill on a maximum water depth of approx. 3.700 m.</p>
				<p>They can sail from one location to another with no problems, unlike the Jack-Up or some of the Semi-Subs which needs to be towed by powerfull tug boats.</p>
