				<h1>Onshore Drilling </h1>
				<p>Well, unlike offshore drilling, for land drilling we have only one option: to use a Land Rig</p>

				<p>All personnel is accomodated at the rig site in container rooms and they will work based on a fixed schedule just like the people working offshore.</p>
				<p>Working on the land rig is more convenient. All equipments/materials are ready available, and have no delays due to bad weather, high waves or strong winds ... Everything is coming by trucks, while crew change days are never delayed, as bus is always coming and going at the right time.</p>
				<p>But nowadays we are pushing everything. Therefore onshore drilling is beeing pushed to offshore.</p>

				<p>What is that meaning ? Well, it's a trend now, in Persian Gulf and in Caspian Sea, to create artificial islands, in the shelter waters close to the shore, connected between thru roads, or bridges, and deploy the Land Rigs on these islands so they can drill and extract from where an offshore rig cannot reach.</p>
