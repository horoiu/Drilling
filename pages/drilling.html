				<h1>What is drilling?</h1>
				<p>Drilling is the process of making a hole (well) in the earth, from surface till the oil reservoir.</p>

				<p>In the beginning, the well is being drilled vertically and then it will be given an angle so will continue to be drilled horizontally.</p>
				<p>The lenght of the well can vary from couple of hundreds of meters till 7 - 8 kilometers. The world's record of longest drilled oil well is 11.424 meters.</p>
				<h1>How we drill ?</h1>
				<p>To drill an oil well we need a very complex equipment, called a drilling rig, and a very high skilled team, in order to design, drill and to put the new well into production.</p>

				<p>There are two types of oil drilling:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Land Drilling, a.k.a. Onshore Drilling;</li>
					<li>Offshore Drilling.</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<h1>Why are we drilling ?</h1>
				<p>Mainly, we are drilling to bring to the surface the natural resources, like oil or natural gases, found deep in the earth.</p>
				<p>But, there is always a BUT, in Middle East is very common to see Land Rigs which are drilling for water wells, in order to bring the fresh water to the population, while in Europe, especially in Germany, we can see a lot of Land Rigs drilling for thermal water wells.</p>
